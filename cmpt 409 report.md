Anagram Groups | 1 | average |  average | Dict, String | For every input string, make a copy and sort it by alphebt order. Then attach the string to list in a dict like {string : list}. Output by group list length.
Asteroids | 3 | good | good | Bipartite Matching | Make vertex for each row X and column Y. If there is a asteroid in [x,y] then connect two vertices. Compute the maximum bipartite matching.
Binary codes | 1 | average | good | sort | Construct n strings by shift the original left n - 1 times. Sort by alphabetical order, find the first one.
Cube stacking | 2 | average | good | union | Move X Y -> union[x].bottom.next = union[y].top Count X -> union[x].height
Dining | 3 | good | average | Network flow | Make two nodes for each cow and connect them, cow-food and cow-drink. Add a super souce for every food, and a super sink for every drink. If connect food and node cow-food if cow like this types, similar for drink. Find the maxium flow on this graph.

Inversion | 2 | avg | avg | permutation and combination | {a1, a2 .. ,ak .. ,am} when {a1 .. ak} are determinined, it can have (m-k)! possibilities. Then use the way we compute binary numbers, to find answer.
A Knight's Journey | 1 | bad | avg | DFS | keep a state then DFS, to see whether it is possible to traverse all positions.
Line of Sight | 1 | avg | avg | geometry | Firstly remove all intervals that don't overlap with house. Then, merge intervals. Compute the gap.
Low Cost Air Travel | 2 | avg | good | shortest path | price is the distance between two cities. After building graph, compute shortest path.
Milking Grid | 3 | interesting | good | KMP | Take each column as a string, find its cyclic substring, record length L1. Take each row as a string, find cyclic substring of length L2. L1 * L2 is the area we want.

Navigation Nightmare | 2 | bad | avg | union | when add a path of two cities, do union merge. As for query, if they are not in same union, cout -1. Otherwise cout the sum of their offest to root.
Out of Hay | 2 | avg | avg | minimum spanning tree | Distances between vertice are given clearly. Run Kruskal.
Paratroopers | 3 | Interesting | good | networf flow | Since the cost is product of every ri and ci. Firstly change it into lg(s) = lg(s1) + lg(s2) + ... + lg(sn). Construct graph with a super source and sink. Add edge from s to cr[i] and ri to cr[i] (capicity lg(ri)), and edge from cc[i] to sink and cc[i] to ci(capacity lg(ci)). And for every enemy [x,y], add edge from row x to colum y with infinite capacity.
